## **Gameplay Mechanics**

### **Player Controls**

* **Movement:** WSAD keys
* **Flashlight Control:** Mouse to aim light source
* **Optional 3D Control:** Mouse wheel to adjust light angle

### **Objectives**

Players must prevent their dog from wandering into dark areas where aliens may abduct them.
Each day offers new routes for walks.

* If **the dog is abducted**, it returns after two days, but its future abduction timer shortens.
* If **the player is abducted**, both wake up safely the next day at the cabin.
* Over time, players may gain **additional dogs** as difficulty increases.

### **Enemies / Obstacles**

Aliens dwell in unlit areas.

* Spending too long in darkness triggers abduction.
* Abductions don’t cause “Game Over” but shift gameplay progression.
* Players who lose a dog will find another stray before the original returns.

### **Rewards / Power-Ups**

* Flashlight upgrades for completing walks.
* Larger illumination areas and improved control over light sources.

## **Level Design**

### **Map Layout and Environment**

Set in a dense coniferous forest with four dog-walking routes:

1. **Short Walk:** A quick stroll near the cabin.
2. **Pond Walk:** A longer path leading to a small pond.
3. **The Path:** A scenic trail alongside the pond.
4. **The Loop:** The longest route that loops back to the cabin.

### **Time of Day**

* Walks occur **twice per day** — afternoon and night.
* **Daytime:** Easier “bonus” levels with light-based exploration and item gathering.
* **Nighttime:** Main challenge mode, where darkness and alien threats dominate.

### **Weather Effects**

Weather directly affects visibility and gameplay:

* **Clear Full Moon:** Minimal flashlight use required.
* **Overcast / Foggy Nights:** Reduced visibility and higher danger.
* **Heavy Fog:** Flashlights become ineffective — even daylight abductions possible.
